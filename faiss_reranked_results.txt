CHAPTER 10
Explainable AI 
for Computer Vision
Most machine learning and deep learning models lack a way of explaining 
and interpreting results. Due to the dynamic nature of deep learning 
models and increasing state-of-the-art models, the current model 
evaluation is based on accuracy scores. ... (BM25 Score: 1.15)

 Summary
Explainability plays a major role going forward, because everyone wants 
to understand what is going on behind the scenes. Business leaders will 
have a hard time believing the AI models. Without being able to explain 
the results, all AI solutions are incomplete, and it's no different ... (BM25 Score: 0.49)

 What Is Computer Vision
Computer vision deals with specific problem sets that rely on images 
and videos. It tries to decipher the information in the images/videos in 
order to make meaningful decisions. Just like humans parse an image or 
a series of images placed sequentially and make decisions... (BM25 Score: 0.22)
