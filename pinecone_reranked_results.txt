CHAPTER 10
Explainable AI 
for Computer Vision
Most machine learning and deep learning models lack a way of explaining 
and interpreting results. Due to the dynamic nature of deep learning 
models and increasing state-of-the-art models, the current model 
evaluation is based on accuracy scores. ... (BM25 Score: 1.73)

 Summary
Explainability plays a major role going forward, because everyone wants 
to understand what is going on behind the scenes. Business leaders will 
have a hard time believing the AI models. Without being able to explain 
the results, all AI solutions are incomplete, and it's no different ... (BM25 Score: 1.04)

This stands for neural based decision trees. Many algorithms are proposed 
for explainability of models, but the concept of results interpretability 
is missed.

 What Is Computer Vision
Computer vision deals with specific problem sets that rely on images 
and videos. It tries to decipher the information in the images/videos in 
order to make meaningful decisions. Just like humans parse an image or 
a series of images placed sequentially and make decisions... (BM25 Score: 0.65)
