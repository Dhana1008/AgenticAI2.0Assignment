      "Explainable AI for Computer Vision refers to techniques used to interpret and understand the decisions made by computer vision models. This is important because most machine learning and deep learning models are \"black-box\" models, meaning their internal workings are not transparent. Explainable AI helps to build trust in the results generated by these models by providing insights into how they work and what factors influence their decisions. Some popular techniques for explainable AI in computer vision include CAM, Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), and Neural-Based Decision Trees (NBDT).\n",
